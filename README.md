# Embedded_Sytem_Keil_ARM_Codes
This repository contains my lab files for Embedded Systems. The files include source code, data sheets, and other relevant resources that were created as part of my coursework.  Each lab file corresponds to a specific Embedded Systems concept or application, and includes a brief description of the project's purpose and functionality.
