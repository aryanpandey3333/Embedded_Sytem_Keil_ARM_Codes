# Embedded_Sytem_Keil_ARM_Codes
This repository contains my lab files for Embedded Systems. The files include source code, data sheets, and other relevant resources that were created as part of my coursework.

Each lab file corresponds to a specific Embedded Systems concept or application, and includes a brief description of the project's purpose and functionality. The files are organized by lab session and cover a range of topics, including microcontrollers, sensors, and real-time operating systems.

The lab files also include documentation that provides an overview of the Embedded Systems concepts used and the results obtained. This documentation can be used as a reference guide for anyone interested in Embedded Systems or for those who are looking to expand their knowledge and skills in this area.

Overall, these lab files provide a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about Embedded Systems. They are suitable for students, researchers, and professionals who are interested in exploring and applying Embedded Systems in their work.
